# Fencing training buzzer
This repository contains circuit diagrams and PCB files for training buzzer circuits for sport fencing. These devices are intended to be attached directly to the plug of a foil respectively epee and will beep and flash a LED for a short period of time if a hit is detected. The buzzer circuits are powered by 1F 5.5V supercapacitors and thus can be recharged quickly by connecting them to a 5V wall adapter.
